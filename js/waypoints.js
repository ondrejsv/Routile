/* Reduce a tour to the fewest waypoints that still force a router to drive it.

   A navigation app takes its own fastest path between waypoints. Coverage
   routing does the opposite - it backtracks and re-enters - so a leg is only
   safe when the fastest path between its endpoints *is* the stretch we intend:

       leg node_i -> node_j is admissible  iff  cost(our sub-walk) == dist(i, j)

   Comparing costs rather than paths matters. The tour revisits nodes
   constantly, and a sub-walk with a repeat can never equal a simple path, so
   path equality would break at almost every step. With positive weights a walk
   containing a repeat is strictly dearer than dist, so the cost test rejects
   revisits for free. Integer deciseconds throughout, so it is exact.

   It cannot fix equal-cost ties - a short leg and the margin re-check make them
   unlikely, not impossible. Mid-street waypoints limit the damage: even on a
   different approach the router still drives the street the waypoint sits on. */

/* Waypoints that pin `circuit` down, starting and ending at its origin. One
   Dijkstra per *emitted* waypoint, not per candidate: prefix sums make testing
   a candidate O(1), so a leg costs one search however far it extends.

   `stops` are tour positions a waypoint must land on exactly - where one
   session ends and the next begins - each { position, name, stop }: `stop`
   is the index of the place stopped at, or undefined for a plain cut. No leg
   runs past one, and the waypoint sits on the node itself rather than along
   the arc before it, since that node is the destination. */
