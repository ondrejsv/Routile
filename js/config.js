   EMPIRICAL. Reversals left where somewhere else to go existed, over 39 km2:

       penalty        90 s    300 s    900 s   1800 s   100000 s
       one-way  rev      8        1        1        1          1
       both     rev     16       11       11       11         11

   Flat from 300 s up, including a control at 100000 s: what remains is forced
   by the layout - a junction with one other exit and no way back to it, where
   the arrival can only pair with the reversal.

   18000 rather than 300 because this has to be a ban, and it stops being one as
   soon as anything else is expensive too. At CONNECTOR_PENALTY_S = 600 a
   three-connector detour costs 1800, and the solver starts trading:

       U-turn price      connector price 300 s   600 s   1200 s
       1800 s                                1       5        9
       18000 s                               1       1        1

   At 18000 the two cannot interact. Costs are integer deciseconds in an

/* Hairpin onto different tarmac. Legal, so a preference, and nearly free -

       one-way      10       3        1        0
       both         17       6        1        0

   The table counts turns past UTURN_DEGREES. It misses the ones the taper
   prices and nothing reports: at a tight fork the swing onto the far arm
   measures around 138 degrees, is charged a third of this, and at 90 s that
   came to 27 s - too cheap to avoid, and a turn you cannot take in one
   movement. Priced over the whole tapered range instead, measured with the
   fork at the D2 ramps (48.10530/17.09388) as the test:

       penalty              90 s    240 s    600 s

   240 buys it for 0.3%; 600 only costs more. What matters more than the value
   is that it is separate from UTURN_PENALTY_S: with one price for both, it had
   to be low enough not to distort hairpins, which made it too low to stop
   reversals - and at some junctions it preferred the reversal to the legal
   hairpin that would have replaced it. */
